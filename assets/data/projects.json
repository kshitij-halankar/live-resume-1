To secure the data transfer between IOT connected to the network, the data is encrypted with AES encryption, hence the data can't accessed by any unauthorized user. Server authentication is secured using 3 level kerberos authentication which uses combination of MD5 and AES for ticket generation. Server maintains log of the data transferred on the network. This log is encrypted using Blowfish algorithm."
